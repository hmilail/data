Introduction to DevOps
```

1
```
Devops is basically combination of two words-
```

2
```
Development and Operations.
```

3
```
DevOps is a culture that implements the technology in order to promote colloboration between the developer team and the operations team to deploy code to production faster in an automated and repeatable way.
```

4
```
Why DevOps?
```

5
```
The goal of DevOps is to increase an organization's speed when it comes to delivering applications and services.
```

6
```
Many companies have successfully implemented DevOps to enhance their user experience including Amazon, Netflix, etc.
```

7
```
Facebook's mobile app which is updated every two weeks effectively tells users you can have what you want and you can have it.
```

8
```
Now ever wondered how Facebook was able to do social smoothing?
```

9
```
It's the DevOps philosophy that helps Facebook ensures that apps aren't outdated and that users get the best experience on Facebook.
```

10
```
Facebook accomplishes this true code ownership model that makes its developers responsible that includes testing and supporting through production and delivery for each kernel of code.
```

11
```
They write and update their true policies like this but Facebook has developed a DevOps culture and has successfully accelerated its development lifecycle.
```

12
```
Industries have started to gear up for digital transformation by shifting their means to weeks and months instead of years while maintaining high quality as a result.
```

13
```
The solution to all this is- DevOps.
```

14
```
How DevOps is different from Traditional IT?
```

15
```
Traditional IT has 1000s lines of code and is created by different teams with different standards whereas DevOps is created by one team with intimate knowledge of the product.
```

16
```
Traditional IT is comples to understand and DevOps is easily unstandable.
```

17
```
DevOps Lifecycle
```

18
```
DevOps lifecycle is the methodology where professional development teams come together to bring products to market more efficiently and quickly.
```

19
```
The structure of the DevOps lifecycle consists of Plan, Code, Building, Test, Releasing, Deploying, Operating, and Monitoring.
```

20
```
- Plan: Determining the commercial needs and gathering the opinions of end-user by professionals in this level of the DevOps lifecycle.
```

21
```
- Code: At this level, the code for the same is developed and in order to simplify the design, the team of developers uses tools and extensions that take care of security problems.
```

22
```
- Build: After the coding part, programmers use various tools for the submission of the coding to the common code source.
```

23
```
- Test: This level is very important to assure software integrity. Various sorts of tests are done such as user acceptability testing, safety testing, speed testing, and many more.
```

24
```
- Release: At this level, everything is ready to be deployed in the operational environment.
```

25
```
- Deploy: In this level, Infrastructure-as-Code assists in creating the operational infrastructure and subsequently publishes the build using various DevOps lifecycle tools.
```

26
```
- Operate: At this level, the available version is ready for users to use.
```

27
```
Here, the department looks after the server configuration and deployment.
```

28
```
- Monitor: The observation is done at this level that depends on the data which is gathered from consumer behavior, the efficiency of applications, and from various other sources.
```

29
```
Best Practices to follow:
```

30
```
- Implement automated dashboard
```

31
```
- Keep the entire team together
```

32
```
- Allow DevOps to be a cultural change
```

33
```
- Be patient with the developers
```

34
```
- Maintain a centralized unit
```

35
```
- Build a flexible infrastructure
```

36
```
Advantages:
```

37
```
1. Faster Delivery: DevOps enables organizations to release new products and updates faster and more frequently, which can lead to a competitve advantage.
```

38
```
2. Improved Collaboration: DevOps promotes collaboration between development and operations teams, resulting in better communication, increased efficiency, and reduced friction.
```

39
```
3. Improved Quality: DevOps emphasizes automated testing and continuous integration, which helps to catch bugs early in the development process and improve the overall quality of software.
```

40
```
4. Increased Automation: DevOps enables organizations to automate many manual processes, freeing up time for more strategic work and reducing the rick of human error.
```

41
```
5. Better Scalability: DevOps enables organizations to quickly and efficiently scale their infrastructure to meet changing demands, improving the ability to respond to business needs.
```

42
```
6. Increased Customer Satisfaction: DevOps helps orgaanizations to deliver new features and updates more quickly, which can result in increased customer satisfaction and loyalty.
```

43
```
7. Improved Security: DevOps promotes security best practices, such as continuous resting and monitoring, which can help to produce the risk of security breaches and improve the overall security of an organizations's systems.
```

44
```
8. Better Resources Utilization: DevOps enables organizations to optimize their use of resources, including hardware, software, and personnel, which can result in cost savings and improved efficiency.
```

45
```
Disadvantages:
```

46
```
1. High Initial Investment: Implementing DevOps can be a comples and costly process, requiring significant investment in technology, infrastructure, and personnel.
```

47
```
2. Skills Shortage: Finding qualified DevOps professionals can be a challenge, and organizations may need to invest in training and development programs to build the necessary skills within their teams.
```

48
```
3. Resistance to Change: Some employees may resist the cultural and organizational changes required for successful DevOps adoption, which can result in resistance, resistance to collaboration, and reduced efficiency.
```

49
```
4. Lack of Standardization: DevOps is still a relatively new field, and there is a lack of standardization in terms of methodologies, tools, and processes.
```

50
```
This can make it difficult for organizations to determine the best approach for their specific needs.
```

51
```
5. Increased Complexity: DevOps can increase the complexity of software delivery, requiring organizations to manage a larger number of moving parts and integrate multiple systems and tools.
```

52
```
6. Depedency on Technology: DevOps relies heavily on technology, and organizations may need to invest in a variety of tools and platforms to support the DevOps process.
```

53
```
7. Need for Continuous Improvement: DevOps requires ongoing improvement and adaptation, as new technologies and best practices emerge.
```

54
```
Organizations must be prepared to continuously adapt and evolve their DevOps to remain competitive.
```

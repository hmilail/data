How DevOps Works
```

1
```
DevOps is a software development methodology that improves the collaboration between developers and operations teams using various automation tools.
```

2
```
These automation tools are implemented using various stages which are a part of the DevOps Lifecycle.
```

3
```
Goal: The goal of DevOps is to increase an organization speed when it comes to delivering applications and services.
```

```
Many companies have successfully implemented devOps to enhance their user experience like amazon, netflix etc.
```

5
```
Example:
```

6
```
Facebook's mobile app which is updated every two weeks effectively telling users you can have what you want and you can have it.
```

7
```
Now ever wondered how facebook was able to do the social smoothing?
```

8
```
It's the DevOps philosophy that helps facebook and sure that apps aren't outdated and that users get the best experience Facebook.
```

9
```
Facebook accomplishes this true of code ownership model that makes its developers responsible that includes testing and supporting through production and delivery for each kernel of code.
```

10
```
They write and update its true policies like this but Facebook has developed a DevOps culture and has successfully accelerated its development lifecycle.
```

11
```
Industries have started to fear up for the digital transformation by shifting their means to weeks and months instead of years while maintaining high quality as a result.
```

12
```
The solution to all this is DevOps.

How DevOps Works?
```

14
```
The DevOps Lifecycle divides the SDLC lifecycle into the following stages:
```

15
```
1. Continuous Development:
```

16
```
This stages involves committing code to version control tools such as Git or SVN for maintaining the different versions of the code, and tools like Ant, Maven, Gradle for building/packaging the code into an executable file that can be forwarded to the QAs for testing.
```

17
```
2. Continuous Integration:
```

18
```
The stage is a critical point in the whole DevOps LifeCycle. It deals with integrating the different stages of the DevOps lifecycle and is, therefore, the key in automating the whole DevOps Process.
```

19
```
3. Continuous Deployment:
```

20
```
In this stage the code is built, the environment or the application is containerized and is pushed onto the desired server.
```

21
```
The key processes in this stage are Configuration Management, Virtualization, and Containerization.
```

22
```
4. Continuous Testing:
```

23
```
The stage deals with automated testing of the application pushed by the developer.
```

24
```
If there is an error, the message is sent back to the integration tool, this tool, in turn, notifies the developer of the error, If the test was a success, the message is sent to Integration-tool which pushes the build on the production server.
```

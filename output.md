Python code to download P.D.F. file from file server (if file exists) U.R.L. and extract plain text from the downloaded file
ChatGPT:
Certainly! You can use the requests library in Python to download the P.D.F file from a file server and then use the Py P.D.F. two library to extract the plain text from the downloaded file.

```

1
```
Here’s an example code snippet to achieve this

```

2
```
Python
Copy code
Import requests
Import py P.D.F. two
D.E.F. download underscore P.D.F. underscore file opening parentheses U.R.L. comma file underscore path closing parentheses colon
Response equals requests dot get opening parentheses U.R.L. closing parentheses

```

3
```
If response dot status underscore code equals equals two hundred colon
With open opening parentheses file underscore path comma single quote W.B. single quote as file colon

```

4
```
File dot write opening parentheses response dot content closing parentheses
print opening parentheses double quote P.D.F. file downloaded successfully period double quote closing parentheses

```

5
```
Else colon
Print opening parentheses double quote failed to download P.D.F. file period double quote closing parentheses
D.E.F. extract underscore plain underscore text opening parentheses file underscore path closing parentheses colon

```

6
```
With open opening parentheses file underscore path comma single quote R.B. single quote closing parentheses as file colon
P.D.F. underscore reader equals py P.D.F. two dot P.D.F. file reader opening parentheses file closing parentheses

```

7
```
Plain underscore text equals double quote double quote
For page underscore num in range opening parentheses P.D.F. underscore reader dot num pages closing parentheses colon

```

8
```
Page equals P.D.F. underscore reader dot get page opening parentheses page underscore num closing parentheses plain underscore text plus equals page dot extract underscore text opening parentheses closing parentheses

```

9
```
Return plain underscore text
Hashtag example usage

```

10
```
U.R.L. equals double quote H.T.T.P. colon slash slash example dot com slash file dot P.D.F. double quote
File underscore path equals double quote downloaded underscore file dot P.D.F. double quote
File underscore path equals double quote downloaded underscore file dot P.D.F. double quote

```

11
```
Download underscore P.D.F. underscore file opening parentheses U.R.L. comma file underscore path closing parentheses
Plain underscore text equals extract underscore plain underscore text opening parentheses file underscore path closing parentheses

```

12
```
Print opening parentheses plain underscore text closing parentheses
Make sure to replace the U.R.L. variable with the actual URL of the PDF file you want to download.

```

13
```
The file underscore path variable represents the path where the downloaded P.D.F. file will be saved on your local machine.

```

14
```
Note that the code uses the py P.D.F. two library for extracting plain text from the PDF file.

```

a string is an object of type string whose value is text
internally, the text is stored as a sequential read dash only collection of char objects
there's no null dash terminating character at the end of a C sharp string; therefore a C sharp string can contain any number of embedded null characters (single quote backslash zero single quote)

```

1
```
the length property of a string represents the number of char objects it contains, not the number of unicode characters
to access the individual unicode code points in a string, use the stringinfo object
string versus system dot string
in C sharp, the string keyword is an alias for string; therefore, string and string are equivalent
it's recommended to use the provided alias string as it works even without using system semicolon
the string class provides many methods for safely creating, manipulating, and comparing strings
in addition, the C sharp language overloads some operators to simplify common string operations

```

for more information about the keyword, see string
for more information about the type and its methods, see string.
declaring and initializing strings
you can declare and initialize strings in various ways, as shown in the following example:
C sharp
copy
slash slash space declare without initializing new line
string space message one semicolon new line new line
slash slash space initialize to null new line
string space message two space equals space null semicolon new line new line
slash slash space initialize as an empty string new line
slash slash space use the empty constant instead of the literal double quote double quote new line
string space message three space equals space system first character uppercase dot string first character uppercase dot empty first character uppercase semicolon new line new line

```

```
slash slash space initialize with a regular string literal new line
string space old path first character uppercase space equals space double quote C. colon backslash backslash program first character uppercase space files first character uppercase backslash backslash microsoft first character uppercase space visual first character uppercase space studio first character uppercase eight point zero double quote semicolon new line new line
slash slash space initialize with a verbatim string literal new line
string space new path first character uppercase space equals space at sign double quote C. colon backslash program first character uppercase space files first character uppercase backslash microsoft first character uppercase space visual first character uppercase space  studio first character uppercase space nine point zero double quote semicolon new line new line

```

```
slash slash space use system dot string if you prefer new line
system first character uppercase dot string first character uppercase space greeting space equals space double quote hello first character uppercase space world first character uppercase exclamation mark double quote semicolon new line new line
slash slash space in local variables (I.E. within a method body) new line
slash slash space you can use implicit typing
V.A.R. space temp space equals space double quote uppercase I. single quote M. space still space a space strongly dash typed space system first character uppercase dot string first character uppercase exclamation mark double quote semicolon new line new line

```

```
slash slash space use a C.O.N.S.T. string to prevent single quote message four single quote from new line
slash slash space being used to store another string value new line
C.O.N.S.T. space string space message four space equals space double quote you space can single quote T. space get space rid space of space me exclamation mark double quote semicolon new line new line
slash slash space use the string constructor only when creating new line
slash slash space a string from a char asterisk, char opening bracket closing bracket, or S. byte asterisk see new line

```

```
slash slash space system dot string documentation for details new line

string space alphabet space equals space new space string opening parentheses letters closing parentheses semicolon
you don't use the new operator to create a string object except when initializing the string with an array of chars
initialize a string with the empty constant value to create a new string object whose string is of zero length

```

7
```
the string literal representation of a zero dash length string is double quote double quote
by initializing strings with the empty value instead of null, you can reduce the chances of a null reference exception occurring
use the static is null or empty opening parentheses string closing parentheses method to verify the value of a string before you try to access it
immutability of strings
string objects are immutable: they can't be changed after they've been created
all of the string methods and C sharp operators that appear to modify a string actually return the results in a new string object
in the following example, when the contents of S. one and S. two are concatenated to form a single string, the two original strings are unmodified

```

8
```
the plus equals operator creates a new string that contains the combined contents
that new object is assigned to the variable S. one, and the original object that was assigned to S. one is released for garbage collection because no other variable holds a reference to it
C sharp
copy
string space S. one space equals space double quote uppercase A. space string space is space more space double quote semicolon new line
string space S. two space equals space double quote than space the space sum space of space its space chars perios double quote semicolon new line new line

```

9
```
slash slash space concatenate s1 and s2. this actually creates a new new line
slash slash space string object and stores it in S. one, releasing the new line
slash slash space reference to the original object new line
S. one space plus equals space S. two semicolon new line new line
system first character uppercase dot console first character uppercase dot write first character uppercase line first character uppercase opening parentheses S. one closing parentheses semicolon new line
slash slash space output: a string is more than the sum of its chars.
because a string "modification" is actually a new string creation, you must use caution when you create references to strings

```

10
```
if you create a reference to a string, and then "modify" the original string, the reference will continue to point to the original object instead of the new object that was created when the string was modified
the following code illustrates this behavior
C sharp
copy
string space S.T.R. one space equals space double quote hello first character uppercase space double quote semicolon new line
string space S.T.R. two space equals space S.T.R. one semicolon new line
S.T.R. one space plus equals space double quote world first character uppercase double quote semicolon new line new line
system first character uppercase dot console first character uppercase dot write first character uppercase line first character uppercase opening parentheses S.T.R. two closing parentheses semicolon new line

```

11
```
slash slash output: hello

quoted string literals
quoted string literals start and end with a single double quote character (double quote) on the same line
quoted string literals are best suited for strings that fit on a single line and don't include any escape sequences
a quoted string literal must embed escape characters, as shown in the following example:
C sharp
copy
string space columns space equals space double quote column first character uppercase space one backslash T. column first character uppercase space two backslash T. column first character uppercase space three double quote semicolon new line

```

```

13
```
slash slash output: double quote the Ã†olean harp double quote, by samuel taylor coleridge
verbatim string literals
verbatim string literals are more convenient for multi dash line strings, strings that contain backslash characters, or embedded double quotes
verbatim strings preserve new line characters as part of the string text
use double quotation marks to embed a quotation mark inside a verbatim string
the following example shows some common uses for verbatim strings

```

14
```
C sharp
copy
string space title space equals space double quote backslash double quote the first character uppercase space backslash U. zero zero uppercase C. six olean space Harp first character uppercase backslash double quote comma space by space samuel first character uppercase space  taylor first character uppercase space coleridge first character uppercase double quote semicolon new line

raw string literals
beginning with C sharp eleven, you can use raw string literals to more easily create strings that are multi dash line, or use any characters requiring escape sequences
raw string literals remove the need to ever use escape sequences
you can write the string, including whitespace formatting, how you want it to appear in output

```

17
```
a raw string literal
starts and ends with a sequence of at least three double quote characters (double quote double quote double quote)
you're allowed more than three consecutive characters to start and end the sequence in order to support string literals that contain three (or more) repeated quote characters
single line raw string literals require the opening and closing quote characters on the same line
multi dash line raw string literals require both opening and closing quote characters on their own line
in multi dash line raw string literals, any whitespace to the left of the closing quotes is removed from all lines of the raw string literal
in multi dash line raw string literals, whitespace following the opening quote on the same line is ignored

```

18
```
in multi dash line raw string literals, whitespace only lines following the opening quote are included in the string literal
the following examples demonstrate these rules
C sharp
copy
string space single line first character uppercase space equals space double quote double quote double quote friends first character uppercase say double quote hello double quote as they pass by period double quote double quote double quote semicolon new line

indent double quote double quote double quote semicolon
the first two examples are invalid because multiline raw string literals require the opening and closing quote sequence on its own line
the third example is invalid because the text is outdented from the closing quote sequence

```

24
```
you should consider raw string literals when you're generating text that includes characters that require escape sequences when using quoted string literals or verbatim string literals
raw string literals will be easier for you and others to read because it will more closely resemble the output text
for example, consider the following code that includes a string of formatted J.S.O.N.

```

31
```
warning
when using the backslash X. escape sequence and specifying less than four hex digits, if the characters that immediately follow the escape sequence are valid hex digits (I.E. zero to nine, A. to F., and A. to F.), they will be interpreted as being part of the escape sequence

```

32
```
for example, backslash X. uppercase A. one produces double quote Â¡ double quote, which is code point U. plus zero zero A. one
however, if the next character is double quote A double quote or double quote A. double quote, then the escape sequence will instead be interpreted as being backslash X. uppercase A. one uppercase A. and produce double quote à¨š double quote, which is code point U. plus zero A. one A.
in such cases, specifying all 4 hex digits (E.G. backslash X. zero zero uppercase A. one) will prevent any possible misinterpretation.

```

33
```
Note
at compile time, verbatim and raw strings are converted to ordinary strings with all the same escape sequences
therefore, if you view a verbatim or raw string in the debugger watch window, you will see the escape characters that were added by the compiler, not the verbatim or raw version from your source code
for example, the verbatim string at sign double quote uppercase C. colon backslash files dot T.X.T. double quote will appear in the watch window as double quote uppercase C. colon backslash backslash files dot T.X.T. double quote
format strings
a format string is a string whose contents are determined dynamically at run time

```

34
```
format strings are created by embedding interpolated expressions or placeholders inside of braces within a string
everything inside the braces (opening curly brace dot dot dot closing curly brace) will be resolved to a value and output as a formatted string at run time
there are two methods to create format strings: string interpolation and composite formatting
string interpolation
interpolated strings are identified by the dollar sign special character and include interpolated expressions in braces
if you're new to string interpolation, see the string interpolation - C sharp interactive tutorial for a quick overview
use string interpolation to improve the readability and maintainability of your code
string interpolation achieves the same results as the string dot format method, but improves ease of use and inline clarity

beginning with C sharp ten, you can use string interpolation to initialize a constant string when all expressions used for placeholders are also constant strings.
beginning in C sharp eleven, you can combine raw string literals with string interpolations
you start and end the format string with three or more successive double quotes
if your output string should contain the opening curly brace or closing curly brace character, you can use extra dollar sign characters to specify how many opening curly brace and closing curly brace characters start and end an interpolation
any sequence of fewer opening curly brace or closing curly brace characters is included in the outpu

verbatim string interpolation
C sharp also allows verbatim string interpolation, for example across multiple lines, using dollar sign at sign or at sign dollar sign syntax
to interpret escape sequences literally, use a verbatim string literal
an interpolated verbatim string starts with the dollar wign
character followed by the at sign character
you can use the dollar sign and the at sign tokens in any order: both dollar sign at sign double quote dot dot dot double quote and at sign dollar sign double quote dot dot dot double quote are valid interpolated verbatim strings

substrings
a substring is any sequence of characters that is contained in a string
use the substring method to create a new string from a part of the original string
you can search for one or more occurrences of a substring by using the index of method
use the Replace method to replace all occurrences of a specified substring with a new string
like the substring method, replace actually returns a new string and doesn't modify the original string
for more information, see how to search strings and how to modify string contents

null strings and empty strings
an empty string is an instance of a system dot string object that contains zero characters
empty strings are used often in various programming scenarios to represent a blank text field
you can call methods on empty strings because they're valid system dot string objects
empty strings are initialized as follows
C sharp
copy
string space s space equals space string first character uppercase dot empty semicolon new line
by contrast, a null string doesn't refer to an instance of a system dot string object and any attempt to call a method on a null string causes a null reference exception

```

61
```
However, you can use null strings in concatenation and comparison operations with other strings
The following examples illustrate some cases in which a reference to a null string does and doesn't cause an exception to be thrown

using string builder for fast string creation

```

66
```
string operations in dot net are highly optimized and in most cases don't significantly impact performance
however, in some scenarios such as tight loops that are executing many hundreds or thousands of times, string operations can affect performance
the string builder class creates a string buffer that offers better performance if your program performs many string manipulations
the string builder string also enables you to reassign individual characters, something the built dash in string data type doesn't support
this code, for example, changes the content of a string without creating a new string

strings, extension methods and L.I.N.Q.
because the string type implements I. enumerable less than T. greater than, you can use the extension methods defined in the enumerable class on strings
to avoid visual clutter, these methods are excluded from intellisense for the string type, but they're available nevertheless
you can also use L.I.N.Q. query expressions on strings
for more information, see L.I.N.Q. and strings
